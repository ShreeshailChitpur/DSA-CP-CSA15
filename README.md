# Inventory Management System using Hashing and File Management

This is our course project for data structures and algorithm that implements a inventory management system using hashing and file management for storage and easy retrieval of items. 

# Features:

- Add new items
- Remove items
- Display items from file
- Display items that need to be restocked
- Uses hashing to store items and retrieve them quickly
- Option to use other hash functions (multiplicative hash function)
